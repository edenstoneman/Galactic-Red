                        Hey, Daveman - hope you're well. Times are tough and I hope life is treating you fairly. <br><br> We had decided to go ahead with the Traegar mission. It's a darned good plan that we all worked very hard on. <br><br>Control has given us the go ahead. We will be launching in a weeks time.
                        <br><br>
                        We need you to drop off some supplies at the Traegar Launch Pad. Obviously, you can't do it in person because of the lockdown, but you'll be able to access the Rover Garage from here.

                        <li>We need a spare space suit on board. Full kit.</li>
                        <li>The Infrared Scanner we currently have is faulty, so drop over another one.</li>
                        <li>Ryan told me that there's a fuel tank missing but he doesn't know which size...</li>
                        <li>Solar Panels need to be installed on the port side. I believe we just need a panel.</li>
                        <li>The rocket is covered in dust. It's been left out there so long, we need some chemicals to clean it.</li>
                        <li>The telescope requires a new lens and Yang said she'd like another star map brought to the rocket. I told her it's all digital but she was taught by her grandfather how to navigate the stars.</li>
